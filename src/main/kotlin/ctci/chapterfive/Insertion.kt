//  You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method in Kotlin to insert M
//  into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space
//  to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.
//  You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
