//Imagine a literal stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life we would likely
//start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. In Kotlin, implement a data structure SetOfStacks
//that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one
//exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack.
